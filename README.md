We thank the reviewers for spending their valuable time reviewing our manuscript and providing very valuable comments.

(1) The core parts of our CBN are the "CholeskyBatchNormSPD" and "CholeskyPt" in nn.py. The nn.py and functional.py also contain some other classes and functions used to implement the proposed model, please kindly refer to them. 

(2) The Response.pdf contains some charts and experiments closely related to our response, please kindly refer to it.

The implementation of our CBN is based on the code of SPDNetBN [7]. We would like to express our sincere thanks to the authors.
